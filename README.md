# Yet another **PHP data validator**

## The *What*:
Just a simple validation library. Give it both a rule set and some data and *voil√†*! It's probably not very special, nor the best validation lib out there... But it's mine and I love it!

## The *Why*
I'm not the biggest PHP fan, but it's pretty much everywhere I have worked at. Even when developing newer services in another language, PHP is always there to be maintained. So, in an effort to start getting things done on my github, thought about getting something I needed for work and making it into a library.

## TODOs:
* the 'HOW' readme section
* add more validators
* UNIT TESTS
* find out how to release as a composer package and, well, release it as a composer package
